Our paper on continual learning has been accepted at **ICLR 2024**! We propose a theoretically principled and empirically effective method for CL. Feel free to explore our [code](https://github.com/linhaowei1/TPLR) and [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15048.pdf). This research was conducted during my undergraduate studies under the guidance of Prof. Bing Liu.
