I’m contributing to the open-source project [OpenEvolve](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve), a community implementation of [AlphaEvolve](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphaevolve-a-gemini-powered-coding-agent-for-designing-advanced-algorithms/)—a scientific discovery agent from DeepMind designed to develop better algorithms for open problems. Check out its performance on [Symbolic Regression benchmarks](https://github.com/codelion/openevolve/tree/main/examples/symbolic_regression)!
