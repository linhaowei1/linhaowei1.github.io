[TFG](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15761v1) and [OmniJARVIS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00114) have been accepted at **NeurIPS 2024**! In TFG, we present a unified training-free guidance method for diffusion models, evaluated across **16 tasks** spanning image, audio, and geometry domains. OmniJARVIS, developed in collaboration with Team CraftJARVIS, is an end-to-end VLA (Vision-Language-Action) agent for open-world Minecraft.
