Glad to launch a new [blog](linhaowei1.github.io/scaling_law_discovery/blog/index.html) on [Scaling Law Discovery (SLD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21184) (paper). We hope our work on SLD helps advance foundation model development and push the boundaries of AI Scientist. [Code](https://github.com/linhaowei1/SLD), [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pkuHaowei/sldbench), [benchmarks](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor/pull/151), and [leaderboard](https://linhaowei1.github.io/scaling_law_discovery/) are all publicly available.
