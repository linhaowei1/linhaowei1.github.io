Glad to launch a new [blog](https://algorithmicsuperintelligence.ai/blog/openevolve-sldagent/index.html) on [Scaling Law Discovery (SLD)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21184) with [OpenEvolve](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve), in collaboration with Algorithmic SuperIntelligence Labs. We hope our work on SLD helps advance foundation model development and push the boundaries of AI Scientist. [Code](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve/tree/main/examples/sldbench), [dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/pkuHaowei/sldbench), [benchmarks](https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor/pull/151), and [leaderboard](https://linhaowei1.github.io/scaling_law_discovery/) are all publicly available.
