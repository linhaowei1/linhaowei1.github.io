I am Haowei Lin(林昊苇), a third year Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, co-advised by [Prof. Yitao Liang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yliang/) and [Prof. Jianzhu Ma](https://majianzhu.com/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), Peking University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/) on OOD detection, continual learning and NLP. We are the first to propose the task of continual pre-training for LLMs ([EMNLP22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05549), [ICLR23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=m_GDIItaI3o)), and the first to apply OOD detection methods to continual learning ([EMNLP23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05083), [ICLR24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15048)).

I am passionate about designing next-generation digital AI that deeply integrates into the real world. Currently, I focus on the foundations and applications of **Generative Foundation Models (GFMs)**:

- **Unification for Multimodality**. I aim to create useful experiences that apply to both diffusion ([flow-matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216) included) and autoregressive architectures, and across modalities including langauge, video, MDP, [3D and molecules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278). For foundation models, I also focus on their [scaling law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02314) and [training-free guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15761).
- **AI for Scientific Discovery**. I am interested in applying GFMs to create superhuman intelligence for [complex reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02810), [open-world gaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08367), and [discover new laws in space physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994) or [neural network scaling](https://linhaowei1.github.io/assets/pdf/EvoSLD.pdf).

I am a member of [Team CraftJarvis](https://craftjarvis.github.io/), which is dedicated to creating generalist agents for open-world environments. Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy engaging in music-related activities, including singing, playing the guitar, and participating in choirs.

If you're interested in working with me on GFMs / AI Scientist, please contact me through e-mail.
