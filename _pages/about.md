I am Haowei Lin(林昊苇), a second year Ph.D. student at the Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Peking University, co-advised by [Prof. Yitao Liang](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yliang/) and [Prof. Jianzhu Ma](https://majianzhu.com/).

I received my Bachelor's degree in Artificial Intelligence from [Yuanpei College](https://yuanpei.pku.edu.cn/en/aboutyuanpei/collegeprofile/index.htm), Peking University, where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Bing Liu](https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/) on OOD detection, continual learning and NLP. We are the first to propose the task of continual pre-training ([EMNLP22](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05549), [ICLR23](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=m_GDIItaI3o)), and study the theoretical equivalence between OOD detection and continual learning ([EMNLP23](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05083), [ICLR24](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15048)).

I am passionate about designing next-generation AI that deeply integrates into real world. My primary research focus is in the field of machine learning, with specific interests in **Generative Foundation Models** ([LLM scaling law](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02314), [3D autoregressive model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278), [training-free diffusion guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15761), [discrete flow matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14216)). Currently, I am working on LLM for scientific discovery (e.g., [physical law discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07994)) and complex reasoning ([open-world game agent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.08367), [multi-turn reasoning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.02810)).

I am a member of [Team CraftJarvis](https://craftjarvis.github.io/), which is dedicated to creating generalist agents for open-world environments. Outside of my professional interests, I enjoy engaging in music-related activities, including singing, playing the guitar, and participating in choirs.

If you're interested in working with me on foundation model / AI Scientist, please contact me through e-mail.
